# HR Resume Processing System  

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that parses resumes and saves the extracted information into a database. It provides an efficient solution for HR teams to process and manage resumes in a streamlined manner.  

---

## Features  
- **Resume Parsing**: Automatically extracts key details such as name, contact information, skills, education, and work experience from uploaded resumes.  
- **Database Integration**: Saves parsed resume data into a connected database for easy access and management.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and simple user experience.  
- **Flexible Input Formats**: Supports multiple file types such as PDFs and Word documents.  

---

## Technology Stack  
- **Python**: Core programming language used for the application.  
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.  
- **Database**: SQLite or any preferred database to store parsed data.  
- **Resume Parsing Library**: Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `docx`, or `pdfplumber` for extracting resume content.

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system.  
- Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  

### Steps  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-resume-processing-system.git  
   cd hr-resume-processing-system  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run main_v2.py  
   ```  

4. Open the app in your browser:  
   The app will launch in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## How It Works  

1. **Upload Resume**: Users can upload resumes in supported file formats.  
2. **Parsing**: The system extracts relevant data using text parsing techniques.  
3. **Review and Save**: Parsed data is displayed for review and saved to the database.
